Today it's quite interesting and exciting. One thing I don't consider is to let me share the "Getting service type" word file. Before that, there is no related sign or saying to let me do this. So I feel very nervous. 

As they are all in Sales Strategy department, their English is so fluent and fast that I almost capture the key points of their speaking. But I know the sign to let me start this meeting and tell about the word file in brief. Due to the lack of preparation, my mind goes blank. I never start a meeting with business, it need much experience and encourage/guts to finish it. Now I must challenge myself, and I talk about the main process flow chart through the word file and some related information with them.  

Tomorrow will continue.
