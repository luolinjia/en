I was born in the twelfth moon(the traditional Chinese calendar). According to the Western calendar my birthday could be the Jan. That's not important for today's topic.  

Until now I also think it's the most interesting stuff about the number 1222 of my birthday, maybe I will forget it if it's not funny. I have no habitation of the birth party and hate the formalized outcome, although the most people like it. I am only able to remember my only birthday party.  

The scene is rather simple but sweet: my friends came to my house with a big birthday cake. Although I didn't like these, I felt warm and moving, then we started to blow out the candles after I had made a wish. When they took the chopsticks up and prepared to have the meal, I felt that I became a stranger at table and my heart touched the sadness. It seemed like that my soul escaped from my body, watched them in a strange sight. The happiness at this moment led to the sadness at next, we could learn to grow up from these views, otherwise we became old. I hated this feeling, it made you feel alone, made you realize that you were a single person. Maybe I, even my parents, didn't pay attention to our birthdays, actually there was no need to do it. Even if this is my true feeling, I thank my friends very much.  

When reminding us of our birthday, we should remember what we had done, what we had learnt in the past year. On the contrary the birthday was not important for us. If you had the gains, please give yourself a reward which let you happy. Otherwise, encourage yourself to make more effort.
