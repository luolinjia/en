According to the schedule, I need finish the outline tasks from 01/19 to 01/30 and I'm not good at the backend code and I have to spend much time to solve these issues. Maybe the Frontend is my favourate developing from now on. Backend codes and logic still trouble me except that the google analysis which I love its data of my website.  

I have more confidence to talk with others in English since I walk to my company with listening ESLpod English and I will follow up the recording mp3. In fact, it is useful to improve English speaking and listening. Walking in normal speed the path to company will spend me about 45m, and it's one hour if I walk slowly. Totally, it's a healthy and positive way to exercise our bodies by this.  

Below is the sunset scenery pictured by me when I passed by this road:
