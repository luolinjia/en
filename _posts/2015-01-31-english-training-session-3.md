Maggie, my English Training tutor, spent 1h on checking the previous homework, so we had the poor time to study today's new key points. Never mind, I could also learnt some unknown English knowledge. 

e.g.  

- The difference between **version** and **edition**
  - **version** : A version of something is a particular form of it in which some details are different from earlier or later forms.
  - **edition** : An edition is the total number of copies of a particular book or newspaper that are printed at one time.
- The difference between **persuade** and **convince**
  - **persuade** : Maybe no result.
  - **convince** : The most of to convince could be successful.
- The difference among **wage**, **salary**, **income** and **pay**
  - **wage** : The short period time
  - **salary** : per month or per year
  - **income** : the main AT salary (p.s. The word **outcome** is not opposite to **income**, it means result from somewhere.)
  - **pay** : Your pay is the money that you get from your employer as wages or salary.


Regarding the Indian accent I felt difficult to control it totally, so I only tried my best to hear the accurate result about it. Actually I had to habit it to service my work with onshore.

Next we started to skill up about *How to grab key points of paragraph* which is significant to me. 

e.g.  

> At first glance, it looks like any other bird gliding through the air. However, in fact this groundbreaking gadget is actually a bionic bird controlled by an app. It can fly upto 100m away from its owner (and their phone), and future versions will be fitted with an HD camera. Made from foam, the Bionic Bird gets its power from a charger shaped like an egg, and can fly for eight minute slots on a single charge. The bird, currently at the prototype stage, would communicate via Bluetooth for arrange of 100 meters. and weighs eight grams. The Bionic Bird uses sensors from the iPhone or iPad to control the bird. Now, the French startup behind it has turned to crowdfunding to raise money for it. 'Throughout history man has dreamed o flying,' the firm says, 'Today, Bionic Bird offers the opportunity to experience that extraordinay sensorial adventure: to fly like a bird.'  

So we will skim it with some simple words, and it looks like:  

> Thru the Bionic Bird, a device APP, we could use it to control it, which is made from foam, and its charge shape looks like an egg, and it weighs 8 gram, and it may last 8m on a single charge.  

There's no left time to study new knowledge, and we will continue at next weekend.
