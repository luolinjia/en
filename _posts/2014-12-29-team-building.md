When we finished our team weekly meeting, the PM, we called him Eric, asked us:『Are we going TB? Because the weather is **sunshine**.』. Typically we would behave the happiness, but today we all felt that nothing happened. As it was so sudden, we didn't know the detail plan and trip, so we decided to discuss it when we were on the load to the temporary destination which was changed to ShaPin Park in the subway later.   

- **Step1** : we left from company at 3:00P.M. and arrived at the subway station at 3:30P.M. After another 30m we reached the ShaPin Park and began to go for a walk in it. It was interesting to see some people dancing and singing, though they were old and not weak, their states of mind showed very good. Of course, I loved the sunshine better:

- **Step2** : when the time was about 5:45p.m., we started to go to the roast duck hot-pot. I didn't realize that it was a small **hot-pot** as its name was **Beijing Roast Duck** and I thought that we only came here to taste roast duck. To be honest, the roast duck was so greasy, it led that I just ate few pieces of it.

Certainly, each of us had a pot to cook some vegetables and mutton slices:

In a word, that's good! I like it.

- **Step3** : when we were done this, we continued to go home. And I bought a cake for my girlfriend before that and wished that she liked it.

Not bad, go for a sleep!
