Today, **Jan 24th**, I attend in the English training at 9:30 a.m. secondly.  

The topic is :

> How to crack a long sentence?  

Of course, the beginning with reviewing the last week's paperwork is my thought.  

Secondly, going thru the fundamental grammar makes me dream back to high school.  

> (S: Subject, V: Verb, O: Object, C: Complement, P: Predicative)  
> 5 basic sentence patterns  
> - **S + V**  
> - **S + V + O**  
> - **S + V + O + O**  
> - **S + V + O + C**  
> - **S + V + P**  
  
Lastly, we discuss how to crack the below long sentences together:  

- What is harder to establish **is** whether the productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over **is** for real.
- These passionate aqunatic explorers take the TED stage to share what they've seen in the abyss of Earth's last frontier - the ocean - and what it means for all of us on land.  
- Behaviorists suggest that the child who is raised in an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or her capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual development.  
- The poor are the first to experience technological progress as a curse which destroys the old muscle-power jobs that previous generations used as a means to fight their way out of poverty.  
- Television, it is often said, keeps one informed about current events, allows one to follow the latest development in science and politics, and offers an endless series of programs which are both instructive and entertaining.  
- If we were prepared for this unusual reaction, and realized that it was a sign that the computer was rebooting and running by the backup system, we could not be so worried, and therefore would not shut down it immediately and raise a ticket to IT dept.  

It's full!
