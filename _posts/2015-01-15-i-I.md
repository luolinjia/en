I learn about an interesting sentence which we can practice by.  

> It is his big pig.  /I/ 

If we could speak it correctly, that's excellent! As Chinese, it is diffcult for us to speak out the pronunciation of this sentence accurately. Because we will treat its pronunciation as /i/'s short syllable and actually it's inaccurate.
