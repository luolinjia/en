Actually, today is Sunday which we should not work in company, but my girlfriend and I are on foot in Zhaishanping Park from 2:30PM to 5:00PM. Although it makes us quite tired, we feel very significant. Because I never climb this park before, even it locates closely to our office. Following I will show some photos pictured by me this afternoon:
