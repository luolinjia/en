> I have been a interviewer today again, and the last time is in April 2014 in my memory.  

I arrived at company at about 9:30a.m. Next I finished the task which Maggie assigned to us and prepared some relevant data for interviewing.  

According to the offical time, the interview started at about 1:30 p.m. I was surprised by the many people around the hall and I calculated that it would last for a long time. From now on, I understood the total interview process in HP:  

- Written examination(Due to time issue, we cancel it!)
- PMs select randomly some members from them.
- Interviewers, e.g. me, do the 1st interview and it mainly contains **Background, Technology, Occupation Plan, English Ability**  
- PMs will do the double check and send the offers at last.  

Maybe Chonging is an inland city, the most interviewers' English is relatively poor. I always feel that they couldn't understand what I said, of course, they can't introduce themselves with some simple words, even if they have prepared the English self introduction. To be sure, two women are exceptions, they could chat with me fluently and I get so relaxing and enjoying the interview.  

It's about 7:30p.m. after finishing the interview, regarding the result, it looks good in total. 7 people are offered! Of course, the two girls I interviewed are pretty! (haha...)
