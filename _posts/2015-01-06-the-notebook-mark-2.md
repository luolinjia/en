Mark:  

- He looked at her. She was pretty still, with thick hair and soft eyes, and she moved so gracefully that it almost seemed as though she were gliding. He'd seen beautiful women before, though, women who caught his eye, but to his mind they usually lacked the traits he found most desirable. Traits like intelligence, confidence, strength of spirit, passion, traits that inspired others to greatness, traits he aspired to himself.  
- "Do you think it would be possible to start over?" She looked at him curiously. "You were the best friend I ever had, Allie. I'd still like to be friends, even if you are engaged, and even if it is just for a couple of days. How about we just kind of get to know each other again?"
- "You kept it?"  "Of course I kept it. It's wonderful." She gave him a skeptical look, and he explained. "It makes me feel alive when I look at it. Sometimes I have to get up and touch it. It's just so real - the shapes, the shadows, the colors. I even dream about it sometimes. It's incredible, Allie - I can stare at it for hours." "You're serious," she said, shocked. "As serious as I've ever been." She didn't say anything. 
- They rocked for a while, drinking tea, sitting quitely, drifting in their thoughts. The compulsion that had driven her here was gone now - she was glad for this - but she worried about the feelings that had taken its place, the stirrings that had begun to sift and swirl in her pores like gold dust in river pans. She'd tried to deny them, hide from them, but now she realized that she didn't want them to stop. It had been years since she'd felt this way.  
- "I should go," she finally said, handing the quilt back to him. Noah nodded, then stood without a word. He carried the quilt, and the two of them walked to her car while fallen leaves crunched beneath their feet. She started to take off the shirt he'd loaned her as he opened the door, but he stopped her. "Keep it," he said. "I want you to have it."  She didn't ask why, because she wanted to keep it, too. She readjusted it and crossed her arms afterward to ward off the chill. For some reason, as she stood there she was reminded of standing on her front porch after a high school dance, waiting for kiss.
