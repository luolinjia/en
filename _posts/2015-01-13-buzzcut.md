Today I go to the barber shop and make a buzzcut for me. I feel very good. For reasons:  

- It's a great way to save a little cash on trips to the barber.  
- This is a great opportunity for me to get a whole new look, maybe looks younger.    
- I can literally have my hair dry with a towel in a matter of seconds.  
- It is also a perfect way to show me cool and nice.  
- Sleep with buzzcut is more comfortable.  
- The **important** point: My hair loss, it is a best way to reduce bald spot appearance, and my hair is thinning out, it is one best hairstyle for me.
