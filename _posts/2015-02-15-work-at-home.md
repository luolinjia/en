Today, it is my first time to work at home and I feel exciting about this. As I often go to office and think that it's inconvenient to set the VPN and the TOKEN, now I won't get troubles in it and I connect to HP internal network thru the Virtual DigitalBadge, a new way to do it.  

Actually, it is so slow that I almostly get angry with myself and I catch the IT servicer to get the new login the VPN method by PULSE which is HP internal VPN Tool. Then I start to work and no worry about this.  

Happy new work@Home day!
