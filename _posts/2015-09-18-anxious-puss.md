When I recited it this morning, I wasn't able to understand the puss deep emotion to her kittens. Till after I handled it totally by reciting, I felt so sorry about this puss that hoped the strange cat to help her because of her great trouble which made her so anxious. 

In fact, the puss only loves her kittens, maybe it's simple for what she thought.
