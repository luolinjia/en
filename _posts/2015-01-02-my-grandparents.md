I have been back to home, Xiangshui, today. A week ago my grandpa got sick and had to be hospitalized. My father and I would like to have a look at him, so I followed my father back to home house, oh it was too old to become ruins:

The kitchen in it was broken and nobody could use it. I couldn't imagine that it had changed a lot during 2012-2014 3 years.

When my father and I see the sluggish scene, we feel so sad. After all, it is our place of origin, it is my childhood memory and it represents the piece of our life, feeling and history. Not only us, I claim some other people will agree with our ideas.

Of course, I was so happy that my grandpa felt good after leaving hospital. This year, he is highly 87 years old and so healthy, it is diffcult for him. Wish him good health and a long life.
