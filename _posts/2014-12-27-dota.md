It's a long time to play none PC games. So today I play the **Dota** in this evening. During this period of years, I know many famous  players which I like:   

- **YaphetS** : Famous for his SF(shadow fiend) plays, although he doesn't continue his occupation player. And he has changed his job and do the host about DOTA video. This is his video LINK: <http://i.youku.com/u/UMzcyMTMxODQ4/videos>  

- **2009** : My favourate DOTA player until now. From his leaving the DOTA career, he still contributes to the growth of DOTA in China and devotes the DOTA skills' study. He is my most admired player. This is his video LINK: <http://i.youku.com/u/UMzE2OTY2NjUy/videos>  

- **820** : My favourate DOTA EHOME's team leader, and he insists on the occupation DOTA for a long time till I start to work from leaving the college. He makes more effort to EHOME team, and gets a milestone. I also admire this experienced player in DOTA from China.   

P.S. Above LINKS are serviced for China mainland and mainly speak Chinese. If you're out of this, nothing to learn about their related and latest information. I'm sorry about that.
