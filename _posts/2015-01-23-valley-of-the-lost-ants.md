This is a 2013 France animated film, the France name is *Minuscule - La vallée des fourmis perdues*, co-written and directed by Hélène Giraud and Thomas Szabo. I stumbled on Youku.com yesterday. It is so excellent that I couldn't control myself that continue watching it until it comes to an end, even though it has no word and catalog, however its body language is more, its scenarios are very beautiful, and no word could not stop that it becomes quite famous.  

Below are my screenshots I love best!
