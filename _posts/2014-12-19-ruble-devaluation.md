Today I am on the internet for news casually, see the title: 『Ruble Devaluation:How Much is Too Much?』. And the Russian finance ministry said its currency was "extremely undervalued" Wesdneday near 70 to the dollar(now it is 66.81), it had spiked to near 75 this week. But the ruble has strengthened to near 60 per U.S. buck after the Russia government announced a series of measures designed to protect banks and other businesses.  

The above is the News about Ruble devaluation, I don't care the numberical data, instead I wonder what is the impact of the Russia ruble devaluation. 

- Inflation, it will lead to inflation absolutely.  
- Worse life, the total money will not change a lot, but the purchasing power will fall with it and the cost of food will increase more.This will hit the poor partly.    
- Economy, this is diffcult to avoid decreasing.  
- Pensions, the government is bound to cut pensions.  
- Money, the government will print more money if the oil also fall.  
- Investments, the foreign investments will escape from Russia if no better scheme is published during the special period of time.  

From the history of Russia currency devaluation, the Russia government don't allow that it is devaluating continuously and it will take some measurements to prevent this. In my opinion, it is not good news for the total universal economy if ruble continue devaluating, at first it will affect the cooperation with countries in economy communication as the it has become global and we call the Earth the global village, although I don't like Putin who is a powerful politician, that is out-and-out power politics and it will threaten the world peace. After all we amost love peace.
