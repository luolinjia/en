Today I had learnt about the ABC(American Born Chinese,Chinese:香蕉人), when I read more information and found that actually they were rather pathetic. I think that they also wanted to know their original hometown and its culture, but they could not speak Chinese and they don't recognize Chinese traditional culture and values.
