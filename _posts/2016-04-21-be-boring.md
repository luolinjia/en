I have no idea how to think about my happiness, which I have left hand by. Now I'm scared to get married, although there is a word that being steadfast at the age of thirty. This year, I'm 27 and  do thinking of my future and our life(My girlfriend and me) in the latest 3 years.  
 
 Maybe I don't know where is the right road, what I am doing, how I active my life in the future, but I will try my best to let it come true. She won't regret to choose me as her honey partner.
