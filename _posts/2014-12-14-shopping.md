I feel tired and get ready to relax myself, as I get out shopping with my girlfriend today. We originally only plan to go to Hollys Coffee (which comes from Korea), but she also want to go shopping and I can't...  

We arrived at Hollys Coffee in 1:00pm. A quick glance at this coffee shop showed nobody, and I felt too strange to get in it at first. There're actually  three people in a corner after we had ordered and had found a seat to sit.  Two young ladies pictured themselves, another foreign man was still sitting there and working in his laptop. The atmosphere here was really warm, like this:

As time went by, more and more people get to here to enjoy their lives. They behind us were talking about their occupations and the related future. It made little noisy, I hated this feeling. Then we finished it quickly:

Then our dishes were empty, and we layed aside them and had a rest here. In fact we were very full and didn't want to leave from here. In a word, Hollys Coffee is just so-so and I think that Starbuck Coffee is better.   

It was 3:00pm to leave the coffee shop, and we began to go shopping. But the nightware had started, her dream was also started. As we knew, all girls liked to go shopping and never felt tired, it seemed that they made a new girl. They wouldn't be them. Although I didn't like it, it made me happy as I accompanied my girlfriend. At last she bought a black down jacket, she was very pretty when she wore it.   

At the end of today's shopping, a funny thing happened, we wanted to wait for the 277 bus at near bus station, and we didn't notice the last bus time, in fact we had missed the last bus, but we still waited for it there. We were fool at that moment.
