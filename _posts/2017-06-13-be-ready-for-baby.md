Thinking of my last about 30 years, ever I have no idea how to face my ideal thinking currently. Year by year, we become older and older, we are never young and we must play the right role: be parents. Sometimes it's wrong to escape from the living circle, and it's true to bring up a baby and be someone's father.

Yesterday, I had decided to ready for a baby with my dear partner. It's difficult to finish it, but I have the enough power to face it and do better for baby who will appear on the earth. Fighting, you're a man, a strong man, a kind man.
