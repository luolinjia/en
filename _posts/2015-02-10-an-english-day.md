Today, due to more issues regarding our project, I have no extra time to relax myself and I have to work harder to close these bugs. Regarding an urgent bug, which is submitted by **Nor** who comes from Malaysia, I grab this chance and get the encourage to chat with her directly. Her accent sounds like Singapore Accent, maybe her home region locates near Singapore. I feel that my English's level becomes better than before, although I don't almost control myself to correct my spoken English grammar when I talk with her. Next I will have the more confidence to overcome my English.  

Don't worry! Just take it easy!
