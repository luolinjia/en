Baby Bye.  
Here's fly.  
We will watch him, you and I.  
    How he crawls  
    On the walls.  
    Yet he never falls.  
I believe with six such legs  
You and I would walk on eggs.  
    There he goes  
    On his toes.  
    Tickling Baby's nose.  
    
Spots of red  
Dot his head.  
Rainbows on his back are spread;  
    That small speck  
    Is his neck.  
    See him nod and beck!  
I can show you, if you choose,  
where to look to find his shoes.  
    Three small pairs,  
    Made of hairs;  
    These he always wears.  
    
Flies can see
More than we.  
So how bright their eyes must be!  
    Little fly,  
    Open your eye.  
    Spiders are near by.  
For a secret I can tell,  
Spiders never use flies well.  
    Then away,
    Do not stay.  
    Little fly, good day.
