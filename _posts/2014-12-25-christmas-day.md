Today, it's very interesting, as I attend the English corner. Actually the related host is too busy to prepare the English corner game and today is Christmas, so we watch the video about the Christmas history on Youtube. Although we couldn't speak English any more and play games in English, this is also funny to spend the period time. 

- At the early foundation of USA, the Christmas became the first USA holiday.
- There is a tree in the photo of spreading from Germany, this is the source of Christmas tree.
