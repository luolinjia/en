Once there was a little kitty,  
White as the snow;  
In a barn he used to frolic,  
Long time ago.  

In the barn a little mousie  
Ran to and fro;  
For she heard the little kitty,  
Long time ago.  

Two black eyes had little kitty,  
Black as a crow;  
And they spied the little mousie,  
Long time ago.  

Four soft paws had little kitty,  
Paws soft as snow;  
And they caught the little mousie,  
Long time ago.  

Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,  
All in a row;  
And they bit the little mousie,  
Long time ago.  

When the teeth bit little mousie,  
Mousie cried out "Oh!"  
But she slipped away from kitty,  
Long time ago.  

> Why could the author write the simple poetry? Only reason his language is English? It could be. So beautiful English sentence is made of the profound cultural deposits which we like and learn from. It's interesting regarding the cat and mousie.
