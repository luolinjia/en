Today the co-worker named Elena recommends a tea, its name is Buckwheat Tea, not Bitter Buckwheat Tea. She tells me about its light fragrance, it seems that the taste of wheat. I also don't feel bad and become interested in it. Its shape looks like this:

So I make a cup of Buckwheat Tea and smell immediately its faint scent which is similar to the taste of tea. It's very good. Elena says that having it is equivalent to having a meal. However it really refreshs myself and makes me comfortable.

Actually, I like the green tea more than others as I'm never going to stop. It is so tasty that I can't control myself to have a cup of it. Of course, it's inflated to me, and I'm quite gentle.  

As we know the importance of tea in Chinese society and culture, tea houses can be found everywhere. Maybe it's very common, we almost never talk about it in public and on the contrary we chat about all kinds of coffees which is from North America or Southeast Asia or Latin America. Unfortunately it happens in our life, and it is unknowingly becoming more and more.
