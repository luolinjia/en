> Alice Cary: an American poet.  

Why do you come to my apple tree?  

Why do you lock your rosy feet?  

Why on the topmost bough do you get?  

Where is your mate? Come and Answer me?  


> Of course, That is the reason that A bird is very gray. But Alice only wanted to describe a bird gray, and our life.
