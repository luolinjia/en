> He is called Dodger because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table, behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard, --all in a minute.  

> Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to put his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.  


P.S. I have to say sth in my opinion: especially regarding the second sentence, Dodger is so cute and I have to like it.
