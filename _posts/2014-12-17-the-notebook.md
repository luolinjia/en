TWO weeks ago, I had gone to Chongqing Library and requested a card to borrow two books, they were *Bootstrap* and *The Notebook*. The latter, its author is **Nicholas Sparks**, looks better. Then I choose to finish it at first. I like the preface:    

> "I am nothing special; of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."  

ALL AMERICA LOVES *THE NOTEBOOK*  

- "A classic story of love found, lost, and regained...Sparks has a winning combination of style and story."  --Christian Science Monitor  
- "Remarkable and memorable...beautiful."  --Baton Rouge Sunday Advocate(LA)  
- "A highly romantic story."  --Cincinnati Post(OH)  
- "A touching story."  --San Antonio Express News(TX)  
- "A one-night read...Sparks generates authentic emotional power...If you are in need of a good cry, *THE NOTEBOOK* is absolutely the right book."  --USA Today  
- "A wonderful story of love and devotion...beautifully done, but I must warn everyone to have the hankies ready!"  --Under the Covers Book Reviews  

So I couldn't wait to take a read about this book. I will share my feeling and my points of view after I read it.
