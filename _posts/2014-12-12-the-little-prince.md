This is my first English fiction of paperback which I finished, although I don't understand many many new words. Only less words could describe the plump image that makes me warm, even I have no answer how I feel it.  

The author is an air force fighter from France in WAR I and WAR II, his name is **Antoine de Saint-Exupery**. As I don't learn about him, I google to get some info: as a fighter, he drived his battleplane into the sky and disappeared. What a pity he died in young age! Then let's return to the topic!  

In this paper, "I" was not the hero instead **the little prince**, even if the little prince was called the third person. He came from the B-612 planet, then he had escaped his home(that planet) as it happened the catastrophe of the baobabs and he hated that rose besides him in his planet, she always did something stupid that made him disturbing. Then he paid a visit some planets for the departure from it.   

Here is my favourate part: 

> 『Goodbye,』he said to the flower.  
> But she made no answer.  
> 『Goodbye,』he said again.  
> The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.  
> 『I have been silly,』she said to him, at last. 『I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy...』  
> He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.  
> ...  
> And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:  
> 『**Don't linger like this**. You have decided to go away. Now go!』  
> For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...  

Then the little prince left her to visit some neighborhoods. But the grown-ups of the planets were very strange, very odd, very very odd, certainly altogether extraordinary... They were conceited, selfish, greedy and less could be his friend, only one could, but his planet was too small to stay in it with two people. An old gentleman was the second to last,and he told the little prince that they didn't record the flowers because they were ephemeral. It made the little prince very sad, and he remorsed himself:  

> 『My flower is ephemeral,and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!』 That was his first moment of regret.  

And he asked the geograhper where he could visit to. The last station was the planet Earth. There were the huge building's quantity and more and more grown-ups, except these, there were some more roses, then he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe, and he thought:  

> 『I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose.』 And he lay down in the grass and cried.  

Next the fox told him that he tamed his flower, he was responsible for his rose. He understood that it was true between them.At last "I" and the little prince chated with each other, it seemed like true that the little prince would leave me, he could go away, as he was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: he said nothing more, because he was crying...  He missed his flower so much, she was all for him.  

The words are simple relatively and easy, but I always smell something sad that I can't bear, especially he goes away from "me". In the life, we maybe meet some people like the little prince, such as me, I am not a kid, but I can taste the feeling of mood from the little prince.

Maybe you can also...
