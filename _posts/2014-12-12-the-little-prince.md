This is my first time to read an original English fiction, it is a paperback, which I have finished. Although I don't understand too many new words, only fewer words could describe the plump image that makes me warm, actually I have no answer how I feel it.  

The author, his name is **Antoine de Saint-Exupery**, I don't know about him except his name, so I googled to get the following info: he is an air force fighter from France in WAR I and WAR II, after publishing his fiction The little princeand he drove his battleplane into the sky to carry out a task and disappeared in July 1944. What a pity he died in young age!
Then let's get to the topic!  

In this paper, "I" was not the hero instead **the little prince**, even if the little prince was called the third person. He came from the B-612 planet, then he had escaped his home (that planet) as the catastrophe of the baobabs happened to his planet and he hated that rose besides him in his planet, she (p.s. the rose) always did something stupid which made him disturb. Then he paid a visit to some planets after the departure from it.  

Here is my favourate part: 

> 『Goodbye,』he said to the flower.  
> But she made no answer.  
> 『Goodbye,』he said again.  
> The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.  
> 『I have been silly,』she said to him, at last. 『I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy...』  
> He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.  
> ...  
> And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:  
> 『**Don't linger like this**. You have decided to go away. Now go!』  
> For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower...  

Then the little prince left her to visit some neighborhoods. But the grown-ups of the planets were very strange, very odd, very very odd, certainly altogether extraordinary... They were conceited, selfish, and greedy and less possible to be his friend. There is one exception, but his planet was too small for two people. An old gentleman was the second to last, and he told the little prince that they didn't record the flowers because they were ephemeral. It made the little prince very sad, and he regretted that:  

> 『My flower is ephemeral,and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!』 That was his first moment of regret.  

And he asked the geographer who he paid a visit to. The last station was the planet Earth. There were a huge quantity of buildings and more grown-ups, besides these, there were some more roses, then he was beat with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe and he thought:  

> 『I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose.』 And he lay down in the grass and cried.  

Next, the fox that he met somewhere told him that he should tame his flower, he was responsible for his rose. He understood that it was true between his rose and him. At last "I" and the little prince chatted with each other, it seemed true that the little prince would leave me, he could go away, as he was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: He missed his flower so much, she was all for him.  

The words are relatively simple and easy, but I always smell something sad that I can't bear, especially when he goes away from "me". In the life, we maybe meet some people like the little prince, as for me, I am not a kid, but I can taste the feeling of happiness from the little prince.

Maybe you can also own the same mood.
