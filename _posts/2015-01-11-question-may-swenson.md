I find a poem *Question* on the *The Host*(Wrote by Stephenie Meyer) flyleaf.  

> Body my house  
> my horse my hound  
> what will I do  
> when you are fallen  


> Where will I sleep  
> How will I ride  
> What will I hunt  


> Where can I go  
> without my mount  
> all eager and quick  
> How will I know  
> in thicket ahead  
> is danger or treasure  
> when Body my good  
> bright dog is dead  


> How will it be  
> to lie in the sky  
> without roof or door  
> and wind for an eye  


> With cloud for shift  
> how will I hide?  


> ----May Swenson, 1913 - 1989
