Today, my girlfriend and I go to the Chongqing Time Square and get the MOON CAKE as her mid-autumn festival gift, and its name is Fei Moon Cake(菲 月饼).  

Next we look to searching the glasses, for my current glasses is becoming bad. AOJO, EGG, Qianye, LensCrafters and Doctor. And I choose the Doctor as my new glasses, because it makes me more smart and gentle. It costs me ￥699.00. That's good for me.
