Today, **Jan 17th**, I attend in the English training at 9:00 a.m. The teacher, her name is Maggie, comes from Chongqing and graduated from a northern collenge.  

In the first part, everyone would do an introduction to all who attended in this training. Maggie said,"Who wants to be first?", 2m later, I became the first one and I didn't know where did my guts come from afterwards.  

> "My name is Cherry, come from Wanzhou Chongqing. I name Cherry myself because of the Cherry keyboard made in German. I have 3 years experience of working, and 1 year in HP. The SouthWest University is my mother college which located in Chongqing. I used to work in OCA team 2 months ago, but now I'm one member of OCS(One Config Simple). In my responsibility, I will do a good job and make more effort. So if you have any questions, please feel free to contact with me. I would still be on the 2nd floor over there."   

In the next time, we are split some more team with 2 or 3 people, Ervin, Sheldon and I set up a group named CSE which comes from the first letter of three of us and means that communication simply in English. Sheldon, this guy, his English speaking is very fluent. And I learn some useful information from the chatting of us.  

In the last part, Maggie shows some useful words and phrases to help build our working experience better.  

> e.g.  
> - **FYI** : for your information
> - **CC** : carbon copy
> - **concern** : if PM suspect someone, it means that he will make more effort to work. 
> - **My understanding is** ... : although it is a polite way to express someone's ideas, it actually stands for giving your suggestion by his saying.  
> - **Appreciate** : get the big praise from the others.  
> - **involve** : maybe you will care this case.  
> - **aggressive** : 1. positive; 2. overbearing;
> - **unacceptable** : maybe you will be fired if you don't work harder.
> - **you deserve it** : you do the work excellent.  
> - **Performance Evaluation** : PE  

And some scenarios: 

> - **expecting** : maybe it means that one baby is in its mother.
> - **powder my nose** :sometimes it stands that the women go to the WC. 
> - **Would you like to go to the rest room?** : as the previous one, it means to go to the WC. 

Lastly, Maggie assigns the paperwork with 2 pages. It mainly contains understanding and writing some key words to the sentences and phrases. It's interesting to do this, and she shares some helpful learning English websites(<http://www.putclub.com>, <http://en.twwtn.com>).
