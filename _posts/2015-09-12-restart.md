> Every minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution; this gives you a 1,000 percent return on energy!(Brian Tracy)  

I've decided to restart the abandoned English blog until from Feb. of 2015.  

I always make excuses for myself regarding the English blog, maybe it will take more time, but I hope to have a try myself according to Brian Tracy's saying.  

Now below is the detail list:  

- reading or reciting English short article (10 min)
- hand painting on MUJI's sketch (30 min) 
- 1 lesson on the middle grammar (20 min)
- 1 lesson on the middle grammar exercise book (10 min)
- walking on the street with my girlfriend (30 min - 50 min)

I will start the planning for developing my willpower.
