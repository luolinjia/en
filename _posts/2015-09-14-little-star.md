> Today I am reciting the poem out of our office and still stand on the playground in the morning.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Up above the world so high  
Like a diamond in the sky  

When the blazing sun is set  
And the grass with dew is wet  
Then you show your little light  
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night  

Then, if I were in the dark  
I would thank you for your spark  
I could not see which way to go  
If you did not twinkle so  

And when I am sound asleep  
Oft you through my window peep  
For you never shut your eye  
Till the sun is in the sky
