- Have a meal in the Beijing Roast Duck restaurant.
- I borrow some English fiction books which are "The Host" and "The Magician's Nephew" from Chongqing Library with my girlfriend. As the previous book is finished, I will keep the habitation and realize that I become more interested in them.  
- Go to movies which names with "智取威虎山".  
- Nothing else.
