As a **HP** employee, I must master the related **English** skills of SPEAKING, WRITING, and so on. In fact, I only grasp the basic skills about communication with other HPers, and the most employees in China maybe only finish the tasks from USA HP onshore. We could merely understand the English documents or emails, but that's enough.  

I was transferred to another team, and my work was almost same as the previous team which I made no chance to communicate with the foreign HPers, because they always communicated with the offshore's key players in general. So I only did more effort by myself, I studied English anew and I treated myself as a new born baby, and I tried to forget the past English knowledge. I found that the fundamental reason: **my attitude, my willpower and my learning English's methods**. I didn't have no idea how to overcome the difficulties at first, then I learned about the right methods from a related guide book『Put your English up』(it was a Chinese book and this was my translation). Ever since, I am still insistant on it with beginning the phonetic symbols and pronunciation.  

Now I'm on the way to my goal in English leaning.
