Chinese Spring Festival will come soon. I have to go home and would like to have a meal with my parents. I always feel tired, except the way to my hometown which could provide some significant info and spirit to me.   

But on the bus station:  

Damn it! There is a long queue like dragon alive in front of me, why here are so many people standing for bus to my hometown - Wanzhou! Until I get in the bus, it spends me 2.5h to wait for it. Maybe my feet are numb......  

Alough today is Valentine's Day, I have no time to enjoy it!!!
