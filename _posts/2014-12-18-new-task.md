We would like to refactor the related code about the configuration model in R12 with OCS team members. Although the user story looks less this release, it have hided some hidden workload this time in R12 and the code refactor will be changed more than other release.  

Today I track the AutoAttachTS logic on back-end side, it has the relationship with uploading the file and rendering the product list in BOM(Bills of material). In a word it is not as diffcult as I think. But I must make more effort and put myself on customer's shoe, and do a contribute to OCS team. Even I don't like the back-end code, I will adapt the environment in company.
