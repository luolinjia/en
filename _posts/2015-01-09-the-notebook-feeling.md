> The storyline: [The Notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notebook_(novel\))

**The Notebook** which I borrow from Chongqing Library tells a romantic story that will fullfill a woman's dreams, once I start reading it, I couldn't put it down.  

The story touched my heart, not itself, also reminded me of some past happened to me and the same story happened to me when I was young about 13 year-old. Of course, maybe the same was to my previous girlfriend. We liked each other at primary school, and never meet for about 6 years, although we sent more mails to last our relationship, to be the end was to separate from the high school. A few passagers brought tears to my eyes because of the huge resonance.  

Go back to the story, I so loved it, it was a touching tale of true love. What could I say the typical love story? Boy met girl, girl met boy, they fell in love, parents separate them, and then they met each other some years later, get married, and live happily ever after. **But** the story of Nicholas Sparks seems more true, it is a sensory experience reading this story and you feel like you become Noah or Allie, the soulmates. By the end of the book, I really don't get the details, but it is a beautiful love story, a warm love story. It's enough.  

If you are a hopeful **romantic**, then this book is a must read!
