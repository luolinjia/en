Yesterday my girlfriend's friends, two pairs of lovers, would like to pay a visit to our house and have a meal we cook. So in this morning we go to the market to buy some food: **dumplings skin**, **fresh fish**, **pork**, **pork knuckle**, **leeks**, **lettuce**, and other **spices** to stew the pork knuckle. They are heavy so that our hands feel a little acid, and then feel relieved after backing to home. The time is near 1:00P.M. at this moment.  

Now, the cooking show start:   

preparing for the menu list: 1. dumplings; 2. stewed pork knuckle; 3. spicy fish; 4. lettuce shredded pork; 5. potato wire;    

1. Dumplings:  
Actually, it is a little complex to make the stuffing for the dumplings. Its workload mainly contains mixing the pork, leeks and egg: 1) Chop the leeks and put it in the pork; 2) Add an egg; 3) Add some sesame oil and pepper oil; 4) Stir them well.  

2. Stewed pork knuckle:  
It need much time to cook this dish and we often **simmer** it util pork knuckle skin soften, about 2 hours. The steps: 1) Remove the water of the pork knuckle by putting in the boiling, then take out them from boiling and let them dry. 2) Add some oil into skillet, then add some dry red pepper, Chinese pepper and old ginger, at last fry them well. 3) Put the fried pork knuckle into a saucepan, then add some spices. Don't forget to add the amount of salt. 4) The last step, we only need wait for simmering it about 2 hours.  

3. Spicy fish:  
I'm sorry that the dish is made by my girlfriend. I can't remember the detail steps.  

4. Lettuce shredded pork:  
This dish is very easy, but it makes my hands a little acid as it is diffcult to peel the lettuce. I feel that its taste will be good if we put more oil, it's a secret for you.  

5. Potato wire:  
Put the planed wire potato into the water, and add a small amount of salt, to prevent the discoloration of potato in the air. The salt will make the potato crisp. Don't forget add some vinegar when stirring fry, it can enhance the flavor.  

Although I feel some tired, it's enough for me to make them happy and full satisfied. We have this for lasting 1.5 hours, as we chat with each other about work, life and something happy. I can get their content expression from their faces. The life smells like this: **happy**, **content**, **satisfied**. That's enough! Like this sunset:
